// --- Linux and Windows: mpv draws the picture under the page ------------------------------------

// nothing under it shows the desktop. GTK draws each frame with whatever the webview last
// presented, and a page change takes a frame or two to get there, while Rust moves the picture on
// its very next one. So the hole never gets ahead of the picture: it shrinks at once to what the
// picture covers both before and after, Rust moves the picture only once that has been painted, and
// the hole opens the rest once Rust says the picture is there. Moving them together showed the
// desktop for a frame whenever the picture went away (an opened link, whose video is not resolved
