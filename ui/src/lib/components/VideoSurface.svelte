	// --- Music videos (plan 031) -------------------------------------------------------------
	// When the track *is* a music video, the player view draws the video instead of the artwork.
	// mpv stays the audio master: the element is muted and its clock is stapled to mpv's position.
	// Bytes come from Rust over a loopback proxy, so nothing here ever sees a googlevideo URL.
	//
	// This component owns the element and is always mounted (see +layout), so closing the player
	// view no longer destroys the picture. The state the view also reads lives in $lib/video.

	// How the picture is kept in step with mpv. Measured against mpv actually playing the same
	// track, because the guesses before it were all wrong in the same direction:
	//
	//   - Drift is *flat*. Once the two agree they stay agreeing over minutes, so nothing needs
	//     continuous correction.
	//   - A seek is expensive. A tiny buffered one loses ~85 ms of motion; a real mid-stream one
	//     costs about a second of re-buffering, and mpv plays on throughout. A seek issued to close
	//     a small gap therefore *opens* a gap of roughly its own cost, and a loop that seeks
	//     whenever it is out seeks forever. That was the stutter, twice, and it is also where the
	//     steady half-second offset came from: the seek landed exactly its own cost behind.
	//   - A `playbackRate` change is nearly free and holds exactly: 1.5x measured a dead-steady
	//     ratio of 1.500 with no stalls, on a picture that is muted anyway.
	//
	// So the rate does the work and seeking is the exception. A seek is only for a gap too big to
	// trim out in reasonable time (a track change, a scrub, coming back from the tray), and it aims
	// past the target by what the re-buffer will cost. The first sync of a fresh element is one of
	// those cases by definition: resolving the video costs a round trip, so mpv is already a second
	// or two in before the element can seek at all.
	/** Trim bands. A rate write is *not* free on WebKitGTK, whatever the steady-state measurement
	 *  above says: WebKit's GStreamer backend implements a `playbackRate` change as a flushing
	 *  seek, so every write drops the sink's buffers and shows as a flicker (#107). So the rate is
	 *  written twice per correction at most, once to start it and once to end it, and never for
	 *  the wobble that ~4 Hz sampling puts on `drift`. TRIM_TICKS is that guard: about two seconds
